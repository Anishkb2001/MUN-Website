Headquartered in New York City, UNICEF protects and defends the right of every child. Previously called the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, UNICEF was initially set up with the aim to provide relief, in the form of food and healthcare, to children and mothers who were victims of World War II. Later, its jurisdiction was extended to the long term needs of women and children worldwide. The UNICEF became a standing member on the United Nations in 1953. It received the Nobel Peace Prize 1965</div>

      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-7">Dear Delegates,</div>
      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-8">I, Mehul Sancheti have been assigned the honorable task of chairing the UNICEF committee for this Model United Nations conference. On behalf of the ISG family I welcome all delegates to the E.A. MUNC 2018. As we all know, the UNICEF promotes the rights and well being of every child, in everything we do.  Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing on better implementation of policies so that help reaches to the most vulnerable and excluded children, everywhere. The topic that we look forward to discussing during this session is the effects of technology and social media on children. The debates around the pros and cons of advancement in technology have been going on for a long time; similarly unprecedented exposure to social media has stirred the discussion about several<br> ethical issues. Large populations of children and adolescents, under the age of 18, access social media sites sans any monitoring as to what content they are being exposed to. A majority of them have very little or no understanding of the different misuses of these networking websites. Merely spreading awareness about potential threats to the users of<br> these websites or technology hasn’t brought a significant change in the present statistics concerning the safety and well-being of the children of this generation. It is true that modern technology has helped in uplifting the weaker sections of the society but looking at the overall downsides of these recent evolutions, there is much more the youth needs to learn and realize before they are granted access to these assets. With the correct and positive use of technology the world can be made a better place for our digital natives.<br> It is needless to say that the children of today are the leaders of tomorrow, thus ensuring their safety and prosperity is the prime motive of this committee. <br>
        <br> My fellow delegates, it is with the sole aim of attaining sustainable development across the globe that I encourage all delegates to actively contribute to the committee sessions and participate enthusiastically in this conference. There is no end to learning as life never stops teaching. May we all take back with us enough food for thought!<br>
        <br> Delegates, in case of any queries, please feel free to contact the bureau members of the committee. I wish you all good luck; I also hope we witness healthy discussions and a conclusion by consensus to this topic and overall theme of the conference. Remember, sustainable development starts with a safe, healthy and well-educated youth.<br><br>Mehul Sancheti<br>Chair, UNICEF</div>

    <div class="w-container">
      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="ecotext1 text-block-1">Indeed, our accumulated knowledge about the role of technology&nbsp; in children’s lives suggests that they can have both positive as well as negative effects on children, depending on the content we fill them with; the context in which they are enjoyed; the use we make of them; and the individual characteristics of the children using them. Media themselves are not inherently good or bad: they are technologies that can be used in multiple ways. Research conducted around the world suggests that good-quality media products produced for children (television and radio programmes, books, Internet sites, mobile-phone information services, public-education street-sign campaigns, puppet shows, dramas, etc.), can be effective in promoting a host of development goals . &nbsp;&nbsp;

      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="ecotext1 text-block-1">UNICEF has also experimented with developing creative materials through landmark projects. Engaging in various forms of social media is a routine activity that research has shown to benefit children and adolescents by enhancing communication, social connection, and even technical skills. Because of their limited capacity for self-regulation and susceptibility to peer pressure, children and adolescents are at some risk as they navigate and experiment with social media.&nbsp;In this manner, the appeal and popularity of entertainment is used to bring about social change to promote well-being at individual and social levels.</div><img class="image-36" data-ix="popup-5" height="500" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 500px" src="images/stat-1.png" srcset="images/stat-1-p-500.png 500w, images/stat-1-p-800.png 800w, images/stat-1-p-1080.png 1080w, images/stat-1-p-1600.png 1600w, images/stat-1-p-2000.png 2000w, images/stat-1-p-2600.png 2600w, images/stat-1-p-3200.png 3200w, images/stat-1.png 4724w" width="500"></div></div>
