        <div data-ix="scrolleffect-2" class="text-2 text-block-1">For future historians, 2017 will be seen as one of those times when the world tottered on a precipice. We live in increasingly unpredictable times and one cannot ascertain the future. Given the multitude of crises with economic, political, social and even environmental consequences, the future does look bleak. Now more than ever before in the history of mankind, we share a common destiny. You might ask me how the European refugee crisis or the plight of workers in developing nations concerns us. In this age of globalization, we are all deeply interrelated and interwoven in the world’s web and conflict in one end of the world has serious repercussions in another. In the same way, the decisions we take together as global citizens have the power to turn the tables. <br> 
         <br>"At Model UN, you broaden your horizons. By learning and networking, you can be part of the UN’s efforts to establish peace, secure human rights and enable all people to live in dignity."  – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, 24 January 2017. <br> 
         <br>At  EAMUNC, you will be introduced to a wide range of global issues such as transnational organized crime, labour rights in emerging economies, and cybercrime to name a few. Everyone is well informed about the issues that the world faces today, but most fail to identify the remedies. This is a platform for you to convert your awareness into action. Each one of you has something unique to bring to the table. I urge you all to bring your difference, to bring to the discussion your plethora of extraordinary ideas and vision for the future. <br> 
        <br>Let this opportunity ignite the spark within you, let it unite you and your peers towards seeking realistic and long term solutions, let it dare you to challenge the norm and question the existing policies, let it encourage you to take action and influence change, and lastly, let it inspire you to break boundaries. <br>

      <div data-ix="scrolleffect-2" class="text-2 text-block-1"> 
The desire to change the world all sounds very heroic and noble and grand and might seem absurd to many. But is it possible? Is it really possible to change the world, to make huge differences so that people hail us and shower us with praise?
And to me this is what a Model United Nations conferences helps us in doing. It binds in students from different backgrounds and inspires you to think differently, question your understanding of the world around you and to connect with people at a level that transcends global boundaries. An MUN helps you embark on a life-changing journey that will help you develop confidence in leading others, a stronger awareness of global issues.<br>
</br>
In our interconnected and globalized world, we face the same challenges wherever we live. Sustainable Development has become the most debated topic lately. It has raised many controversies between development and environment increasing the its importance and relevance in today’s world.<br>
</br>
Transnational Organized Crime, labour rights in emerging economies, atoms for peace and development are just a few of the topics you shall be introduce to during the conference. I urge you all delegates to bring up innovative and effective remedies to these problems which countries face and relate it to sustainable development during the course of the conference.<br>
</br>
I believe that E.A.MUNC is the perfect platform where to set your differences aside and come together as one in order to ignite a spark of change in the world. I hope all of you have a great time in this conference and make the most out of this conference.<br>
