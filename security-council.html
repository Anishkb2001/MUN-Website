It also accepts new member states to the UN and approves any changes to be made to the UN Charter.</div>

      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-7">Dear Delegates,</div>
      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-8">It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the Security Council at E.A MUNC 2018. I, Abhyuday Bose, am humbled to serve as your Chair for the duration of this conference. It also gives me immense pleasure to introduce you to the Vice Chair, Sowparna Sreekumar and the Rapporteur, Nayan Molly Anil. Together, we are here to guide you and work very hard to ensure that your time at the conference is both fruitful and memorable. <br>
        <br> The Security Council has always been a platform for heated debate and discussion on numerous crises around the world. The complex issues that the committee deals with require prompt and precise solutions to be resolved, and this will require you to think out of the box. After all, complex problems will naturally have complex solutions. The topic to be discussed at the Security Council, Transnational Organized Crimes, is a vast issue and will also require you to come up with effective and substantive solutions, with military, economic and diplomatic responses, which in turn will require you to bring out the best of your negotiating skills. This is because nations have diverse viewpoints, cultures and policies, and the situation varies by region. As representatives of your respective countries, you are expected to draft a resolution for the problem while remaining faithful to your country policies as much as possible. Of course, in order for a solution to truly be effective and unbiased, a degree of compromise is vital. Only when the problem at hand is properly dealt with can the world come closer to achieving sustainable cities and communities and the good health and well-being of its people. <br>
        <br> I cannot wait to meet you all and am eager to see you actively engage in the committee. We aim to bring out the global leaders in all of you and shape you into true creative diplomats, and we are sure that this will be a truly educational experience for all of you, with you discovering more about yourself and the world in the process. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any queries or questions. We wish you all the very best!<br><br><br>Abhyuday Bose<br>Chair, Security Council</div>

      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="ecotext1 text-block-1">Organized crime threatens peace and human security, violates human rights and undermines economic, social, cultural, political and civil development of societies around the world. Transnational organized crime manifests in many forms, including as trafficking in drugs, firearms and even persons. At the same time, organized crime groups exploit human mobility to smuggle migrants and undermine financial systems through money laundering. The vast sums of money involved can compromise legitimate economies and directly impact public processes by &#x27;buying&#x27; elections through corruption.</div><img src="images/stat3_2.png" width="400" height="300" data-ix="popup-4" srcset="images/stat3_2-p-500.png 500w, images/stat3_2-p-800.png 800w, images/stat3_2-p-1080.png 1080w, images/stat3_2-p-1600.png 1600w, images/stat3_2-p-2000.png 2000w, images/stat3_2-p-2600.png 2600w, images/stat3_2-p-3200.png 3200w, images/stat3_2.png 4724w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 400px" class="image-79">
      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="ecotext1 text-block-1">The transnational nature of organized crime means that criminal networks forge bonds across borders as well as overcome cultural and linguistic differences in the commission of their crime. Organized crime is not stagnant, but adapts as new crimes emerge and as relationships between criminal networks become both more flexible, and more sophisticated, with ever-greater reach around the globe. In short, transnational organized crime transcends cultural, social, linguistic and geographical borders and must be met with a concerted response.</div><img src="images/stat2_3.png" width="600" height="400" data-ix="popup-5" srcset="images/stat2_3-p-500.png 500w, images/stat2_3-p-800.png 800w, images/stat2_3-p-1080.png 1080w, images/stat2_3.png 8858w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 80vw, 600px" class="image-36"></div>
