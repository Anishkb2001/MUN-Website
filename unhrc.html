      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-7">Dear Delegates,</div>
      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="text-block-8">It is my honour to welcome you to the United Nations Human Rights Council at the first session of the E.A. MUNC 2018. My name is David P. John and I, with great delight, shall serve as your Chair at UNHRC. Over the last year, I have been able to deliberate on a variety of issues that have proved to be of great global significance at three Model United Nations Conferences. <br>
        <br>The UNHRC is an inter-governmental organisation with one motive and that is to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. The topic that is chosen for the conference, ‘Labour Rights in Emerging Economies’, is a problem of great importance that gravely concerns the world. As globalization paces forward, the interest of the workman has been sacrificed in the fierce race between capitalists and governments worldwide. It is true that economic development and financial power are very important aspects of the modern world, however, what governments world wide<br>often forget is the fact that a happy worker is an efficient worker. In order to build a better tomorrow for our youth, we need to start today. When children see their parents undergoing hardships at their workplace or face some sort of harassment, they will not perceive employment in the right sense. By firms not being socially responsible and governments shying away from their core responsibility to protect its citizens, we are not gifting our children a brighter future as it appeals to them as a curse they have to live with all their lives. Decent work conditions, fair pay and social protection must be the prime focus of businesses and governments worldwide.<br>
        <br>There are too many legal conventions and frameworks regarding the rights of workers but very little has been done to implement them. In some of the most globalised economies, problems like racial discrimination, harassment at workplaces, unsafe work conditions, unavailability of medical leave and lack of workers compensation prevail. The<br> rights to organize, demonstrate and strike are ignored, and workers who attempt them are immediately fired. In most underdeveloped nations, lack of education and lack of awareness among workers are the most dominant factors that have caused their exploitation. This is a humanitarian crisis. In the past various humanitarian crises have been solved through diplomatic interventions and international cooperation has paved the way for societies founded on virtues like ‘equality before law’ and ‘accountable governments’. <br>
        <br>What makes any MUN committee successful is the active participation of its delegates. We here at UNHRC look forward to seeing delegates actively participating in fruitful and constructive deliberation, forging diplomatic alliances and crafting inventive and viable solutions to solve this humanitarian crisis. It is, therefore, with great delight and<br> enthusiasm that I, accompanied by Rhea Shah (Vice Chair) and Mahashwetha Sarkar<br> (Rapporteur), intend to guide and provide you with any assistance that you may<br> require during the conference.<br><br>David P. John<br>Chair, UNHRC</div>

      <div data-ix="scroll-effect-1" class="ecotext1 text-block-1">Labour rights are entitlements that relate specifically to the role of being a worker. Some of these rights are exercised individually and others collectively. They can include the right to work in a job freely chosen and the right to fair working conditions, which may include issues as diverse as a fair wage or protection of privacy; the right to be protected from arbitrary and unjustified dismissal; the right to belong to and be represented by a trade union; the right to strike. These rights may be based on different foundations, such as freedom, dignity or capability.</div><img class="image-49" data-ix="popup-2" height="400" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 700px" src="images/stat5_3.png" srcset="images/stat5_3-p-500.png 500w, images/stat5_3-p-800.png 800w, images/stat5_3-p-1080.png 1080w, images/stat5_3-p-1600.png 1600w, images/stat5_3-p-2000.png 2000w, images/stat5_3-p-2600.png 2600w, images/stat5_3-p-3200.png 3200w, images/stat5_3.png 5905w" width="700">
      <div data-ix="scrolleffect-2" class="ecotext hrctext text-block-1">A recent sudy made by the International Labour Organisation(ILO) focuses on labor rights and laws in an era of globalisation in developed countries such as America, South Asia and Southern Africa where the major issue pertains to gender equality of workers or labourers. This reflects upon the way in which workers protection needs to be centralised and how adequate legal tools can be utilised. Further, the mismatch between the realities of the developing world and the social,economic and political keystones of labor law whose manisfestations have appeared due to globalisation, have left a large number of labourers outside the the scope of labour law and in dire need of protection.</div>
